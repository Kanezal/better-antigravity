## Disclaimer

This project is an unofficial, community-maintained collection of patches for
[Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.dev). It is **not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by Google LLC or any of its subsidiaries.**

## Nature of the Project

Better Antigravity provides **bugfix patches** that restore documented, expected
functionality in Antigravity IDE. Specifically:

- The "Always Proceed" terminal execution policy is documented to auto-execute
  commands, but does not function as described. Our patch restores this behavior.
- All patches are non-destructive: they create automatic backups and can be
  fully reverted at any time.
- No data is collected, transmitted, or shared with any party.

## Compliance

- This project **does not access** Google's backend servers, APIs, or
  authentication systems.
- This project **does not extract** AI models, training data, or proprietary
  algorithms.
- This project **does not bypass** security features, licensing, or
  usage restrictions.
- All modifications are local to the user's machine and affect only the
  client-side UI behavior.

as provided by:

- **EU Software Directive** (Directive 2009/24/EC), Article 6
